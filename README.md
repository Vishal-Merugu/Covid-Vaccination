<h3>Note: </h3>Run this python code in online compiler as it has a module required to run. Use the link given Below to run the python program<br> Website: https://trinket.io/embed/python3/f03e855da4
    <br>Please Give Inputs quickly because the database I was using is an online based testing database so it can't keep connected for long once the program is run.<br>
Please rerun the program if the connection to the database is lost<br>
 <br>Admin perks In code :<br>
    mail = "admin@gmail.com"<br>
    password  = "admin"<br>
<br>I also attached two static HTML pages for login and register but I haven't connected them to the backend instead I wrote full backend code in python.<br>
The front part for my project is online compiler console which I provided above.
